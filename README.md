# EasyQR

A simple QR code generator made on React âœ¨

I create this project to play around a bit with the [qr-code-styling](https://github.com/kozakdenys/qr-code-styling) JavaScript library and also made an article on medium that you can read [here](https://medium.com/@facucarbonel_97514/how-to-create-a-qr-generator-using-javascript-4b5ce1b6ec27).

I had updated this from the version on the Medium article to a React application, so the code shown on that article is outdated (but it's still a working code you can use if you like).

EasyQR is now hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app?referralCode=TaMRb-)ðŸš† , and now you can make your QR codes with EasyQR [here](https://easyqr-production.up.railway.app)!

Don't forget that all the code hosted on my GitHub account is open-source and made with tons of love, so if you want to contribute with what I do, you can always [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/F2BEAR) ðŸ’–
